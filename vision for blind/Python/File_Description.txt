-----	      IMPORTENT: TO RUN THESE APPLICATIONS YOU NEED TO HAVE		-------------
------------------------------- 	OPENCV CONTRIB INSTALLED 	---------------------------------------------

Detector_Video.py: 	This file detects faces using Haar cascades. It works fine with multiple faces.


Face_Capture_With_Rotate.py: Running this file will capture 50 images of a person infront of 	the camera. It will make sure photos are not dark and it will also make the face is straight.


Free_Rotate.py: This file shows the rotate function. Make sure you uncomment line 153 in NameFind.py This will show the image correcting the offset.


 
NameFind.py: This file contains all the functions.


Trainer_All.py: This file will train all the recognition algorithms using the images in the dataSet folder.


Recogniser_Image_All_Algorithms.py: This application will detect and recognise faces from images. Diffrent images can be selected.


Recogniser_Video_EigenFace.py: This File is the will recognise faces from the camera feed using Eigen face algorithm.


Recogniser_video_FisherFace.py: This File is the will recognise faces from the camera feed using Fisher face algorithm.


Recogniser_Video_LBPHFace.py:  This File is the will recognise faces from the camera feed using LBPH face algorithm.


TestDataCollector_EiganFace.py: This file is the test application. It will take in an image the dataset will be loaded. A loop will run 200 times each time increamenting the number of components. Each time an Eigen face recogniser will be trained and predicted on the input image. After the for loop is compleated, ID and confidence will be ploted.
